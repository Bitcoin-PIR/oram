# Direct-entry ORAM batching plan

## Motivation

The current deployed ORAM image wraps the DPF/Harmony `INDEX + CHUNK` PBC
cuckoo tables. That preserves compatibility, but it also preserves the PBC
storage expansion. For a TEE-backed ORAM lookup, the server can execute the
key lookup internally and return results over the encrypted channel, so the
PBC group expansion is no longer necessary.

The next ORAM format should be built from the direct intermediate records:

- `utxo_chunks_index_nodust.bin`: 25-byte records
  `[20B script_hash][4B start_chunk_id][1B num_chunks]`.
- `utxo_chunks_nodust.bin`: direct 40-byte chunk payloads addressed by
  `chunk_id`.

The delta pipeline uses the same direct index/chunk record shape.

## Position-map scan benchmark

`oramctl bench-pos-map` measures three trusted position-map access shapes:

- `direct`: ordinary indexed load.
- `scan`: branchless full scan to select one leaf.
- `scan_update`: branchless full scan that selects the old leaf and writes a
  new leaf with a constant-shape store to every entry.

VPSBG results for the current canonical direct-entry packed sizes, `ops=2000`,
`warmup_ops=200`:

| Direct table | Packed ORAM blocks | Map size | Scan | Scan + update |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Canonical DELTA direct index | 82,808 | 0.316 MiB | 14.5 us | 28.3 us |
| Canonical DELTA direct chunks | 531,611 | 2.028 MiB | 92.6 us | 178.7 us |
| FULL direct index | 885,445 | 3.378 MiB | 153.7 us | 297.5 us |
| FULL direct chunks | 5,061,532 | 19.308 MiB | 877.9 us | 1.71 ms |

Conclusion: full-scan position-map access is acceptable for the current packed
block counts. It is not acceptable if we make every 40-byte chunk its own ORAM
logical block and grow the position map by 16x.

A local macOS development-machine run against the canonical direct dimensions
used a temporary standalone ORAM checkout outside the main BitcoinPIR cargo
vendor override:

```text
cargo run --release --bin oramctl -- \
  bench-pos-map --sizes 82808,531611,885445,5061532 \
  --ops 2000 --warmup-ops 200
```

| Direct table | Packed ORAM blocks | Map size | Scan | Scan + update |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Canonical DELTA direct index | 82,808 | 0.316 MiB | 30.5 us | 34.2 us |
| Canonical DELTA direct chunks | 531,611 | 2.028 MiB | 251.0 us | 329.6 us |
| FULL direct index | 885,445 | 3.378 MiB | 409.6 us | 424.4 us |
| FULL direct chunks | 5,061,532 | 19.308 MiB | 1.99 ms | 3.32 ms |

The VPSBG numbers are the production-relevant ones. The local run is still a
useful guardrail: even on the slower local path, full CHUNK map scan+update is
single-digit milliseconds for `pack=16`, so it is not the dominant term in the
current server-smoke timings. Do not reduce `pack` to 1 for CHUNK without
redoing this benchmark, because that would grow the CHUNK position map by about
16x.

## Direct-entry layout

Keep separate direct ORAM tables:

1. `direct_index`
   - Payload slot: collision-free
     `[1B occupied][20B script_hash][4B start_chunk_id][1B num_chunks]`.
   - Lookup structure: non-PBC cuckoo table over all script hashes, with a small
     fixed number of candidate bins.
   - ORAM payload block packs consecutive direct index bins, for example
     `pack=16`.

2. `direct_chunk`
   - Payload record: direct 40-byte chunk payload.
   - Logical key: `chunk_id`.
   - ORAM payload block packs consecutive chunk records, for example `pack=16`.

The index table may still use cuckoo hashing, but only as a direct dictionary.
It should not be split into 75 PBC groups, and each entry should be stored once
rather than once per candidate PBC group.

## Batched request shape

Add a native ORAM batch endpoint with a fixed public access budget:

```text
OramDirectBatchRequest {
    db_id,
    padded_slots[],
    slot_present[],
    access_budget,
}
```

The server should execute a fixed schedule:

1. For each padded slot, perform a fixed number of direct-index ORAM reads.
   Real slots probe the candidate direct-index bins; explicit empty slots spend
   the same count as random dummy INDEX ORAM path accesses.
2. Decode matches inside the TEE only for real slots.
3. Build a private list of required chunk IDs.
4. Execute up to the remaining fixed chunk-read budget.
5. Fill unused CHUNK access slots with dummy CHUNK ORAM path accesses.
6. If real chunks exceed the budget, return a continuation token/state so the
   client can request another fixed-budget batch.

The important distinction is that the public padding width is the number of
script-hash slots, while the server access budget is the number of ORAM path
accesses. Empty slots do not read a logical INDEX element and therefore do not
create CHUNK demand, but they still read/rewrite random ORAM paths and add the
usual eviction debt.

For a padded request with two direct-index candidates per slot, the budget is:

```text
padded_index_reads = direct_index_candidates * padded_slots.len()
chunk_budget = access_budget - padded_index_reads
```

The request should reject or split batches when
`padded_index_reads > access_budget`.

With the current `hash_fns=2`:

- `padded_slots=50` spends 100 INDEX ORAM path accesses before any CHUNK read.
- `access_budget=120` leaves 20 CHUNK reads for those 50 slots.
- `access_budget=150` leaves 50 CHUNK reads for those 50 slots.
- The old `access_budget=50` can only support 25 padded slots with no CHUNK
  budget, or fewer padded slots if found results need CHUNK reads.

The implemented first cut keeps the request length public and fixed-fills only
within that request's access budget. If real CHUNK demand exceeds the remaining
budget, the server drains the remaining dummy chunk budget, persists the mutated
ORAM state, and returns an error. A production wallet-sync planner should split
such batches ahead of time or add an explicit continuation token.

The web adapter exposes this as an opt-in fixed-budget planner instead of the
DPF/Harmony PBC batch planner:

```ts
planOramScriptHashBatches(scriptHashes, {
  accessBudget: 120,
  indexReadsPerScriptHash: 2,
  expectedChunkReadsPerScriptHash: 1,
  paddedSlotCount: 50,
  chunkReadReserve: 0,
});
```

This example sends every request as 50 explicit slots and derives 20 real
script hashes per request because 100 ORAM accesses are reserved for INDEX and
20 remain for expected CHUNK reads. If the operator wants up to 50 real
script-hash slots with one expected CHUNK each, set `accessBudget` to at least
150. For safer ordinary wallet sync, keep a chunk reserve or an explicit
`maxScriptHashesPerRequest` cap.

## Engineering sequence

1. Add direct table builders in the standalone ORAM repo:
   - parse direct index/chunk intermediate files;
   - emit `direct-index.*` and `direct-chunk.*` ORAM images plus metadata;
   - keep the same tiered Merkle/auth-state machinery.
2. Add an `oramctl size-direct` estimator before building images. (Done.)
3. Add an `oramctl build-direct` command for FULL and DELTA. (Done for the
   standalone ORAM image format.)
4. Add a runtime direct-ORAM reader beside the current cuckoo reader. (Done in
   the main repo worktree; built and smoked from the VPSBG test checkout.)
5. Add a native direct batch request/response type in `pir-sdk-client` and
   `unified_server`. (Done in the main repo worktree.)
6. Keep HarmonyPIR/DPF on their mmap-backed PBC databases. ORAM lookup is a
   separate `REQ_ORAM_LOOKUP` path; legacy PBC-cuckoo ORAM should be only a
   compatibility fallback for that ORAM opcode.
7. Benchmark fixed budgets: 16, 32, 50, 64 ORAM accesses. (Pending beyond the
   50-access synthetic smoke.)
8. Add client-side batch planning: choose `script_hashes.len()` so
   `hash_fns * len + expected_chunks <= access_budget`, split otherwise, and
   later replace overflow errors with continuation tokens if large wallets need
   it.

## VPSBG smoke status

Built direct images:

- FULL: `/home/pir/data/oram/checkpoints/948454-direct-pack16-z2-div2-stash128-auth`
- canonical DELTA:
  `/home/pir/data/oram/deltas/940611_948454_canonical-direct-pack16-z2-div2-stash128-auth`

The canonical DELTA direct input pair was regenerated from the attested-builder
txoutset inputs at builder commit `01e8db91d76037cd5562fce85c40e832ad156431`:

- `utxo_chunks_index_nodust.bin`: 125,867,300 bytes,
  SHA-256 `e06fc3dedf30096124888acef3024f21a9c049d59fd8c7d518aaf8a58ac6aa16`;
- `utxo_chunks_nodust.bin`: 340,230,840 bytes,
  SHA-256 `536acb605396056118c7c0836988f369c5abbfc3f7e90732ad93e819d5188e0a`.

Two-db direct server smoke passed on VPSBG using the real `databases.toml`,
direct FULL as db_id 0, and direct canonical DELTA as db_id 1. The smoke
verified cleartext ORAM rejection and encrypted-channel ORAM queries with
`sev_status=ReportDataMatch`. Synthetic not-found lookup timings were:

- db_id 0 FULL: 647.54 ms;
- db_id 1 canonical DELTA: 698.85 ms.

A second smoke used one known-present FULL script hash and one known-present
canonical DELTA script hash in the same fixed-budget request. It verified found
results, direct CHUNK reads, and client-side result decoding:

- db_id 0 FULL, two script hashes: 635.24 ms, one found UTXO;
- db_id 1 canonical DELTA, two script hashes: 575.75 ms, one found delta
  record.
